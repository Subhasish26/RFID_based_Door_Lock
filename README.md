# RFID_based_Door_Lock
In this study, I have implemented a digital security system contains door lock system using passive RFID. 
The door locking system functions in real time as when the user put the tag in contact with the reader, the door open 
We utilize RFID technology to provide solution for secure access of a space while keeping record of the user.

The main objective is to design and implement a digital security system which can deploy in secured zone where only authentic person can be entered. We implemented a security system containing door locking system using passive type of RFID which can activate, authenticate, and validate the user and unlock the door in real time for secure access. The advantage of using passive RFID is that it functions without a battery and passive tags are lighter and are less expensive than the active tags. A centralized system manages the controlling, transaction and operation task. The door locking system functions in real time as the door open quickly when user put their tag in contact of reader. The system also creates a log containing check-in and check-out of each user along with basic information of user.

I proposed a security system contains door locking system using passive type of rfid.The detail of the proposed scheme is showing below:

Step 1: The RFID reader retrieve the information contains by tag as it come in the range of few millimeters from reader.

Step 2: after receiving the tag information, reader send this information to database for conformation.

Step 3: Once the tag information verified, the system generates a control signal through parallel port which controls the opening and closing of door.
